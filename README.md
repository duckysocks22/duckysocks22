- 👋 Hi, I’m @duckysocks22, but I just go by Socks! (they/them)

- I've recently been learning a lot about Linux in May, but in early July I switched to the rabbithole that is NixOS! I'm still in the process of learning it and piecing everything together but I'm having a lot of fun!
- I also absolutely love playing gacha games, especially the ones by Hoyoverse >:3c
